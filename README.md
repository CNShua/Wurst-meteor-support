## Announce
**This project will not be updated to 1.19.4**

**Update will be stopped at 1.19.3**

## ⚠ It's not perfect. ⚠

This client "fork" changes the command prefix and supports Meteor
It also bypasses updates, but this only modifies the version in the file, so no updates are made.
I will give an update if I am aware of it.
