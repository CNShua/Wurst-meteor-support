<!-- ## TODO:
In the future, we would like to create something that can automatically retrieve the latest version and apply patches.

-->
## What patcher.py?

Drag and drop the zip file downloaded from the [master branch of the original repository](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) and the patch will be automatically applied to the contents of the file.

This theoretically supports Meteor in all Wurst versions!
