# Wurst Client 1.19 With Meteor Support Prefix Change Edition

[EN](README.md) [JP](README_JP.md)

## ⚠ It's not perfect. ⚠

This client "fork" changes the command prefix and supports Meteor
It also bypasses updates, but this only modifies the version in the file, so no updates are made.
I will give an update if I am aware of it.
